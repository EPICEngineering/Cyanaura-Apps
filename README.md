On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak, which is phylogenetically in the SARS-CoV clade. The disease associated with it is now referred to as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people in India is currently considered to be moderate to high, based on the probability of transmission and the impact of the disease. The first step in infectious disease control is detection and diagnosis. The data collection, data curation, and data analysis are also very important. 

It is important to create a contact tracing network of people who are infected by COVID -19 with comprehensive coverage on the transmission methods and traceability of their locations. COVID-19 can spread from imported methods and local transmission methods at the same time. Human body temperature sensors coupled with demographic, details will be an insightful mechanism to implement contract tracing.


# Etymology
Our Project is names as Cyanaura : Cyan is the synonym for 'Blue' colour. 'Aura' is the synonym for Light. Our project will be powered by Bluetooth Low Energy and Encrypted Maps Technology in essence. Cyanaura also sounds like Sayanora. Sayanora is the Japanense word for bidding adieu. Let us bid adieu to Covid19 through Cyanaura Apps
